# Research Datasets

In this repository, I post all datasets that I have constructed. Many of these are small, but you may find use for them yet. If you use one (or more) of my datasets, please cite me (a la the `LICENSE.md` file)! :)

A description for each dataset can be found below:

- **`nonces.csv`**: A list of words used in an experiment on phonotactics, where each row corresponds to an an experimental item with three conditions: a real word, a viable nonce word, and an unviable nonce word. Items with an ID beginning with O have the same rime and coda across all conditions; items with an ID beginning with C have the same onset and rime across all conditions (forthcoming). Viable nonce words were transformed into unviable nonce words via either metathesis of the two consonants or substitution of one of the consonants, in either onset or coda positions accordingly.
- **`mindrhymes.csv`**: A list of rhyme subversions, aka _mind rhymes_, where the listener/reader is meant to recover the intended rhyming word via the inclusion of a non-rhyming word. We specify the lyric, the actual target, the expected target, and the metrical structure for each rhyme. This is a subset of a larger dataset, most of which is licensed material and cannot be publically released.
